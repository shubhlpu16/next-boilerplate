# Next.js Boilerplate with SWR, Redux Toolkit, Chakra UI, TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, and Husky

This is a boilerplate project for creating Next.js applications with the following features:

- [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/): Data fetching library for efficient and simplified API requests.
- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/): State management library for Redux with simplified syntax.
- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/): A simple, modular, and accessible component library.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): Typed superset of JavaScript for enhanced development.
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/): JavaScript and TypeScript linter for maintaining code quality.
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/): Code formatter for consistent code style.
- [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky): Git hooks for automated linting and formatting.
